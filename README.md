# PyBer Analysis

## Overview: 
Pyber is a company which provides ridesharing services using Python-based app.  The analysis had been conducted based on the large CSV files, and its purpose was to look into the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.  The last stage of the analysis was processed to present the total weekly fares for each city type to support the achievement of the company's performance goal.

# Results: 

Based on the line chart with the amount of fare, the analysis gives us an impression that the performance in urban area is the best amonng three types of cities.  However, as the table below shows, in the rural area the profit is better than the one of in urban area based on the average fare per ride and per driver.  This is because the number of drivers in urban area is significatly higher than the one in rural area.  Additionally, the result of the average fare per ride tells us the distance per customerâ€™s ride in rural area must be farther than the one in urban area.

## Summary: 

Based on this analysis, there are three recommendations below:

 1. Reviewing the numbers of drivers in urban area: we may have been retaining more drivers than we need to meet the demand.  Thus, the idle time of the drivers must be high, and Pyber is not using the human asset effectively.  While the number of drivers in rural is about only 3% of the one of urban, the profitability in rural area exceeds due to this factor.        
  
 2. Researching the method of the transportations by the area in each city type to stay current market: this helps to find out which areas have the higher demand of ridesharing than the other areas.  The reason why the rural performance is better than the one in urban must be the scarcity of the public transportation.  Pyber can have the strategic plan which area in the city or which city type to forcas the ridesharing service according to the research.
 
 3. Conducting drivers survey: they are front-line workers in the field and communicate directly with our customers so they may be able to provide the management with good insight for the business plan.  In other words, we can conduct the customers survey through the drivers' eyes. Pyber could possibly give some incentives who gives good lead.  With this survey, it is possible to find nitche service we can start giving to the customers in each city.
